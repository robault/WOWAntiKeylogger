The effect ".fx" files require compilation using either the HLSL compiler from the DirectX SDK (fxc.exe)
or by using the Shader Build Task, which can be found at http://codeplex.com/wpf.

The compiled effect files (".ps") are provided here, but if you make changes to the ".fx" files,
you will need to recompile them. If you use the Shader Build Task, you should delete the ".ps" files
and set the ".fx" file's build action to "Effect".
